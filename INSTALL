Introduction
============

sandboxctl uses the GNU Automake and GNU Autoconf utilities as its build
system.  These are used only when building the package from the source
code tree.  If you want to install sandboxctl from a prebuilt package
provided by your operating system, you do not need to read this
document.

For the impatient:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    Gain root privileges
    # make install
    Drop root privileges
    $ make installcheck

Or alternatively, install as a regular user into your home directory:

    $ ./configure --prefix ~/local
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install
    $ make installcheck


Dependencies
============

To build and use sandboxctl successfully you need:

* bindfs (only on macOS).
* shtk 1.7 or greater.
* pkg-config.

Optionally, if you want to build and run the tests (recommended), you
need:

* ATF 0.17 or greater.
* Kyua 0.6 or greater.

If you are building sandboxctl from the code on the repository, you will
also need the following tools:

* GNU Autoconf.
* GNU Automake.


Regenerating the build system
=============================

This is not necessary if you are building from a formal release
distribution file.

On the other hand, if you are building sandboxctl from code extracted
from the repository, you must first regenerate the files used by the
build system.  You will also need to do this if you modify configure.ac,
Makefile.am or any of the other build system files.  To do this, simply
run:

    $ autoreconf -i -s

If ATF and/or shtk are installed in a different prefix than Autoconf,
you will also need to tell autoreconf where the ATF and shtk M4 macros
are located.  Otherwise, the configure script will be incomplete and
will show confusing syntax errors mentioning, for example, ATF_CHECK_SH.
To fix this, you have to run autoreconf in the following manner,
replacing '<atf-prefix>' and '<shtk-prefix>' with the appropriate path:

    $ autoreconf -i -s -I <atf-prefix>/share/aclocal \
      -I <shtk-prefix>/share/aclocal


General build procedure
=======================

To build and install the source package, you must follow these steps:

1. Configure the sources to adapt to your operating system.  This is
   done using the 'configure' script located on the sources' top
   directory, and it is usually invoked without arguments unless you
   want to change the installation prefix.  More details on this
   procedure are given on a later section.

2. Build the sources to generate the binaries and scripts.  Simply run
   'make' on the sources' top directory after configuring them.  No
   problems should arise.

3. Install the library by running 'make install'.  You may need to
   become root to issue this step.

4. Issue any manual installation steps that may be required.  These are
   described later in their own section.

5. Check that the installed library works by running 'make
   installcheck'.  You do not need to be root to do this.


Configuration flags
===================

The most common, standard flags given to 'configure' are:

* --prefix=directory
  Possible values: Any path
  Default: /usr/local

  Specifies where the library (scripts and all associated files) will
  be installed.

* --sysconfdir=directory
  Possible values: Any path
  Default: /usr/local/etc

  Specifies where the installed programs will look for configuration
  files.  '/sandboxctl' will be appended to the given path unless
  SANDBOXCTL_CONFSUBDIR is redefined as explained later on.

* --help
  Shows information about all available flags and exits immediately,
  without running any configuration tasks.

The following environment variables are specific to sandboxctl's
'configure' script:

* BINDFS (macOS only)
  Possible values: empty, an absolute path.
  Default: empty.

  Specifies the path to the bindfs binary.  If not specified, the
  configure script will try to look for this in the path and abort if
  not found.

* KYUA_FLAGS:
  Possible values: empty, multiple flags as one string.
  Default: empty.

  Specifies additional flags to pass to Kyua when running any of the
  `check`, `installcheck` or `distcheck` targets on this source tree.
  This setting is exclusively used to customize the test runs of Kyua
  itself and has no effect whatsoever on the built product.

* SANDBOXCTL_CONFSUBDIR
  Possible values: empty, a relative path.
  Default: sandboxctl.

  Specifies the subdirectory of the configuration directory (given by
  the --sysconfdir argument) under which sandboxctl will search for its
  configuration files.

The following flags are specific to sandboxctl's 'configure' script:

* --with-atf
  Possible values: yes, no, auto.
  Default: auto.

  Enables usage of ATF to build (and later install) the tests.

  Setting this to 'yes' causes the configure script to look for ATF
  unconditionally and abort if not found.  Setting this to 'auto' lets
  configure perform the best decision based on availability of ATF.
  Setting this to 'no' explicitly disables ATF usage.

  When support for tests is enabled, the build process will generate the
  test programs and will later install them into the tests tree.
  Running 'make check' or 'make installcheck' from within the source
  directory will cause these tests to be run with Kyua (assuming it is
  also installed).


Run the tests!
==============

Lastly, after a successful installation (and assuming you built the
sources with support for ATF), you should periodically run the tests
from the final location to ensure things remain stable.  Do so as
follows:

    $ kyua test -k /usr/local/tests/sandboxctl/Kyuafile

And if you see any tests fail, do not hesitate to report them in:

Thank you!
