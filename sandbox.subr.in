# \file sandbox.subr
# Routines to interact with sandboxes.
#
# This module contains generic code to interact with sandboxes and utility
# functions that sandboxes can call to prepare their contents.  The code in this
# file is OS-independent and has no specific knowledge on how to create the
# various types of sandboxes that depend on the underlying OS.
#
# "Sandbox types" implement the logic to construct sandboxes on various OSes and
# with different configurations.  These types are shipped as invidual modules
# that can be loaded dynamically.  Such modules can make free use of shtk and
# the functions in this file.
#
# Consider a sandbox type A.  Such sandbox type must be implemented in a file
# named A.subr and must provide the following functions:
#
# A_config_vars(): Prints the set of configuration variables that the sandbox
#     type requires for its operation.  All of these variables should be
#     prefixed with A (in uppercase) to prevent conflicts among various modules.
# A_set_defaults(): Initializes the configuration variables to their default
#     values.
# A(): The main dispatcher of sandbox-specific actions.  This dispatcher takes
#     the directory in which the sandbox lives and the action to perform on it,
#     which can be any of the values listed in _SANDBOX_ACTIONS.
