Changes in version 1.1
======================

**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.**

* Fixed the `darwin-native` type to allow accessing the Oracle JRE from
  within the sandbox.

* Expose `/usr/local` in `darwin-native` so that third-party software
  installed on the host, such as OSXFUSE, can be found.

* Expose an empty `/private/var/mail` directory within the `darwin-native`
  sandbox so that programs that expect the directory to exist can work.

* Issue 4: Fixed the `netbsd-native` type to recognize a `/boot` directory
  and to ignore the lack of `/netbsd`, as is the case for
  NetBSD/evbarm-earmv7hf 7.1 Raspberry Pi images.


Changes in version 1.0
======================

**Released on 2017-02-17.**
